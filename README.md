### MÃ¡rcio Oliveira ðŸ‘‹

Hello, thanks for stopping by. I'm currently an Senior Software Engineer (iOS) at [Adnovum Portugal](https://www.adnovum.com/) but I already worked with Android development and other stacks.

I'm a Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ /Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· guy currently living in SetÃºbal, so if you want to know a little bit more about me, feel free to check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcio-oliveira/) and read my articles at [Medium](https://marcio-oliveira.medium.com/). 

If you're also an Android fan like me, maybe you'll like my recent one about [Clean Architecture](https://engineering.talkdesk.com/android-clean-architecture-an-unicorn-approach-a5076d1b409).
