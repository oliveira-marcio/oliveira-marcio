### MÃ¡rcio Oliveira ðŸ‘‹

Hello, thanks for stopping by. I'm currently an Android Developer (and now learning and working with iOS) at [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com) and helping students as a mentor at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).

I'm a Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ /Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· guy currently living in Lisbon, so if you want to know a little bit more about me, feel free to check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcio-oliveira/) and read my articles at [Medium](https://medium.com/@djmso2000). 

If you're an Android fan like me, maybe you'll like my recent one about [Clean Architecture](https://engineering.talkdesk.com/android-clean-architecture-an-unicorn-approach-a5076d1b409).
