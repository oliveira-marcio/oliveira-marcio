### Márcio Oliveira 👋

Hello, thanks for stopping by. I'm currently an iOS Developer/Tech Lead (and former Android Developer) at [LetsGetChecked](https://www.letsgetchecked.com/).

I'm a Portuguese 🇵🇹 /Brazilian 🇧🇷 guy currently living in Setúbal, so if you want to know a little bit more about me, feel free to check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcio-oliveira/) and read my articles at [Medium](https://marcio-oliveira.medium.com/). 

If you're also an Android fan like me, maybe you'll like my recent one about [Clean Architecture](https://engineering.talkdesk.com/android-clean-architecture-an-unicorn-approach-a5076d1b409).
